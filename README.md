# Detail-Arrange for Google Contacts™

Google Contacts™ does not natively let you rearrange phone numbers, email addresses, street addresses, etc. This extension adds arrows that you can click to move these details up and down.

The icon for Detail-Arrange for Google Contacts™ is taken from [http://www.iconarchive.com/show/blogger-icons-by-rafiqul-hassan/Arrow-Updown-icon.html].
